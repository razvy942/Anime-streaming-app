- There. That's my homeroom teacher.

01:19.700 --> 01:20.810
- What's the matter?

01:21.090 --> 01:24.750
- Assistant-kun... Sempai has a tummyache.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.180
- Could you just go in without me?

01:26.180 --> 01:28.560
- Stop talking nonsense already.

01:29.810 --> 01:31.750
- My entire body is in pain!

01:31.750 --> 01:33.740
- What are you talking about?

01:34.470 --> 01:36.650
- If it isn't my little sis!

01:34.470 --> 01:36.650
- No!

- She's your sister, Sempai?!

01:39.090 --> 01:40.110

01:40.110 --> 01:42.470
- No! I do not know this person!

01:42.470 --> 01:44.180
- You're precious, Little Sis.

01:44.180 --> 01:45.920
- Stop calling me that!

01:45.920 --> 01:47.790
- I'm getting the cold shoulder, huh?

01:46.190 --> 01:47.790
- Take care, Assistant-kun!

01:47.790 --> 01:51.540
- She acts like she knows what she's doing,\Nbut she's secretly a total goofball!

01:51.540 --> 01:53.920
- She sounds a lot like you.

01:54.370 --> 01:56.570
- Wow, magic, huh?

01:56.570 --> 01:59.100
- Not like it's any of your business.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.900
- That's right. You {\i1}were{\i0} always\Nplaying around in your room

02:01.900 --> 02:03.880
- with all kinds of rods and balls.

02:03.880 --> 02:04.930
- How did you know that?!

02:04.930 --> 02:05.680
- I want to leave.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.890
- I know.

02:06.890 --> 02:09.650
- As long as you're here, why don't\Nyou show me one of your tricks?

02:09.650 --> 02:11.120
- I'd love to see!

02:11.780 --> 02:12.990
- Well, if you insist.

02:12.990 --> 02:14.030
- She went for it?

02:14.710 --> 02:16.900
- So, using these cards, I will proceed to...

02:16.900 --> 02:18.940
- Are you sure that's right?

02:18.940 --> 02:19.780
- What do you mean?

02:19.780 --> 02:23.340
- You should strike your usual dramatic pose!

02:24.030 --> 02:25.950
- You're embarrassing me! Cut it out!

02:25.950 --> 02:27.290
- I guess she does actually get embarrassed.

02:28.540 --> 02:32.160
- Pick a card and sign your name on it.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.030
- Wow, a real magic trick!

02:34.030 --> 02:36.520
- Now return it to the deck\Nwithout letting me see it.

- Okay!

- Now I'm going to pick\Nyour card out of this deck!

- Go!

02:44.970 --> 02:47.820
- Huh? Only one of them is facing the front...

- I'm going to see how your\Npractice has been paying off.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.070

- Oh, jeez!

04:00.660 --> 04:01.950
- She's making this awkward.

- Let's see, where to start...

04:03.890 --> 04:06.860
- Time for me to seize\Nthe initiative. I'll start with...

04:06.860 --> 04:09.060
- a suggestive comment\Nto throw him off his game!

04:09.060 --> 04:10.560
- Assistant-kun, I can see what you're doing.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.940
- Sure, I can't do the trick otherwise.

04:12.940 --> 04:15.440
- Well, you can still spring back from it.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.060
- Take this seriously, okay?

04:18.060 --> 04:19.320
- I'm starting now.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.440
- First, let's all say hello to Behemoth-kun.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.670
- Sadly lacking.

04:24.670 --> 04:25.530
- What is?

04:25.530 --> 04:27.250
- Well, it's hard to explain.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.950
- There's just something kind\Nof off about your stance.

04:30.830 --> 04:34.620
- What could it be? If I start listing\Noff things that I have and you lack,

04:34.620 --> 04:36.500
- we could be here all day!

04:37.780 --> 04:38.630
- Visuals, perhaps?

04:39.550 --> 04:41.690
- What are you trying to do to me?!

04:41.690 --> 04:43.260
- Wow, he's really serious.

04:43.260 --> 04:46.540
- Well? Well? Can you do this, Sempai?

04:46.540 --> 04:49.450
- If you want to rag on me,\Nat least watch me do it first!

04:49.450 --> 04:50.260
- Argh!

04:51.360 --> 04:54.260
- You ingrate! After all I've taught you!

04:54.260 --> 04:55.270
- You've taught me nothing!

04:55.890 --> 04:58.820
- I'll do the next one, so watch closely.

04:59.270 --> 05:01.670
- I'm going to rag on her for everything.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.070
- Wh-What to do?

05:06.070 --> 05:08.080
- I should probably tell her, right?

05:08.890 --> 05:10.560
- Okay, time to get started.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.170
- I need to say something to\N make her realize it's unzipped!

05:14.170 --> 05:15.490
- Um, Sempai?

05:15.490 --> 05:16.170
- What?

05:17.830 --> 05:19.790
- I can see everything.

05:20.050 --> 05:23.440
- Assistant, dear, you mustn't lie like that!

05:23.440 --> 05:26.780
- I haven't done anything,\Nso there's nothing to see!

05:27.580 --> 05:29.180
- You want a punch in the mouth?

05:29.710 --> 05:31.760
- Today, I'll be performing a card trick!

05:31.760 --> 05:33.940
- Pick a card, any card!

05:34.730 --> 05:37.390
- Damn! I'm so focused on her\Nflower print, I can't focus!

05:37.980 --> 05:40.290
- Now return the card to the deck.

05:41.740 --> 05:45.150
- I'll lightly mark the card\Nhe gave me with my thumbnail!

05:45.150 --> 05:47.620
- Now I just have to find the marked card!

05:47.620 --> 05:49.000
- Just like I practiced!

05:49.420 --> 05:50.280
- I see it!

05:50.280 --> 05:52.970
- Before I guess your card, let me ask you...

05:52.970 --> 05:55.210
- What was the print you saw?

05:55.210 --> 05:56.660
- It was... It was...

05:57.000 --> 05:59.080
- The flower print, of course!

05:59.080 --> 06:02.010
- There's no print like that in cards!

06:02.700 --> 06:05.170
- That assistant of mine is so random.

06:05.670 --> 06:08.920
- There's no flower print in cards.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.560
- There's no...

06:14.470 --> 06:15.810
- Well, that explains that!

06:15.810 --> 06:17.810
- Conquering {\c&HDDCA21&}Sempai

06:16.160 --> 06:17.520
- "Conquering Sempai."

06:17.810 --> 06:20.300
- I wanna fix my stage fright!

06:20.300 --> 06:23.670
- Why don't you ditch the magic stuff\Nand make this a gaming club instead?

06:24.290 --> 06:25.940
- Silly Assistant-kun.

06:26.230 --> 06:28.060
- No one would believe that's a real club.

06:28.060 --> 06:30.070
- She's really getting on my nerves.

06:30.940 --> 06:34.570
- Wow, sounds like there are lots\Nof ways to conquer stage fright.

06:34.570 --> 06:35.820
- Give me one!

06:35.820 --> 06:38.960
- "Drink water. Drinking water will calm you."

06:38.960 --> 06:40.300
- Okay!

06:40.300 --> 06:41.960
- That's too much.

06:42.220 --> 06:44.170
- My tummy's all rumbly.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.770
- You are so stupid.

06:46.690 --> 06:47.970
- What next?

06:47.970 --> 06:50.660
- Let's see... "Steady your breathing."

06:50.660 --> 06:53.990
- "Regulating your breathing\Nwill steady your nerves."

06:57.430 --> 06:58.990
- I think the baby's coming.

06:58.990 --> 07:00.100
- Hold it in, please.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.770
- What next?!

07:04.550 --> 07:06.050
- This might be good.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.250
- Let's have a look!

07:07.250 --> 07:08.490
- Autogenic training?

07:08.770 --> 07:11.650
- It's apparently a method where you\Ninternally repeat phrases read out to you.

07:08.860 --> 07:10.110
- Don't get\N tense

07:10.490 --> 07:12.610
- Don't get\N tense

07:11.650 --> 07:14.760
- It induces a hypnotic state\Nthat allows you to relax.

07:12.610 --> 07:12.870
- I relaxed and\N succeeded!!

07:13.030 --> 07:13.410
- I relaxed and\N succeeded!!

07:13.620 --> 07:17.870
- I relaxed and\N succeeded!!

07:15.700 --> 07:17.870
- I don't know if I get it, but let's try!

07:17.870 --> 07:21.120
- Okay, I'll read the phrase,\Nso repeat it to yourself.

07:21.460 --> 07:22.550
- Okay!

07:23.190 --> 07:24.490
- "My body feels heavy."

07:24.490 --> 07:25.540
- Okay.

07:25.540 --> 07:26.860
- "My body feels warm."

07:26.860 --> 07:27.770
- Okay.

07:27.770 --> 07:29.880
- "My heart is beating quietly."

07:31.400 --> 07:33.010
- "My breathing is easy."

07:33.980 --> 07:35.600
- "My stomach is warm."

07:36.050 --> 07:37.560
- "My forehead is cool."

07:38.570 --> 07:41.020
- Well? Do you feel calmer?

07:42.050 --> 07:43.020
- Wake up.

07:44.750 --> 07:47.400
- "Next, do something to distract yourself."

07:47.900 --> 07:50.300
- Distract myself, eh?

07:50.300 --> 07:55.830
- Oh! Maybe you could tickle my sides\Nwhile I'm performing my tricks?

07:55.830 --> 07:58.450
- You need a cure for mental illness,\N not stage fright.

07:58.450 --> 08:01.270
- It's worth a try! Let's do it!

08:01.270 --> 08:01.990
- Okay!

08:03.030 --> 08:04.820
- Go on, hurry!

08:04.820 --> 08:06.340
- If you insist...

08:06.700 --> 08:07.950
- Jeez...

08:08.360 --> 08:09.500
- So narrow...

08:16.600 --> 08:17.930
- Assistant-kun?

08:17.930 --> 08:19.130
- Um, I just...

08:19.130 --> 08:21.930
- I'm serious, here! \NWould you tickle me already?

08:21.930 --> 08:24.100
- Um, s-sorry?

08:24.100 --> 08:25.400
- She didn't notice?

08:25.400 --> 08:26.660
- My goodness.

08:27.450 --> 08:32.160
- What a hopeless assistant! He can't\Neven perform a task as simple as that!

08:33.500 --> 08:34.710
- Enough!

08:34.710 --> 08:36.990
- I'm sorry! Forgive me!

08:38.270 --> 08:40.770
- I'm done. I can't stand up.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.160
- I'm just happy to be of service.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.330
- Ugh.

08:44.330 --> 08:46.330
- Kimono {\c&HDDCA21&}Sempai

08:44.670 --> 08:46.120
- "Kimono Sempai."

08:47.620 --> 08:49.960
- Ta-dah! I'm doing wazuma today!

08:49.960 --> 08:51.300
- A kimono?!

08:51.300 --> 08:53.000
- And what's wazuma?

08:54.090 --> 08:58.600
- Wazuma is traditional Japanese slight-of-hand\Npassed down through generations.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.350
- In other words, Japanese magic!

09:00.710 --> 09:04.260
- Today I'll do the butterfly dance, \Ncausing paper butterflies to take to the air.

09:02.770 --> 09:03.980
- Butterfly Dance

09:04.260 --> 09:06.190
- Then paper udon, where burning\N paper produces white strings,

09:06.190 --> 09:09.180
- which I then turn into real udon soup!

09:08.110 --> 09:08.980
- Paper Udon

09:09.180 --> 09:12.230
- Then water tricks, where water\Nspouts out of unexpected places!

09:11.360 --> 09:12.230
- Water Tricks

09:12.230 --> 09:14.490
- Wazuma

09:12.230 --> 09:14.490
- These are the three\Nclassics I'll be performing!

09:14.780 --> 09:16.490
- First, the butterfly dance!

09:17.490 --> 09:18.410
- Take that!

09:19.220 --> 09:20.740
- One more time!

09:20.740 --> 09:23.870
- They aren't flying.\NYou're just swatting at them.

09:24.190 --> 09:27.590
- I think you're supposed to flap\Na little more gently, like this.

09:27.590 --> 09:29.870
- W-Well, something like that!

09:29.870 --> 09:33.630
- He learned it so quickly!\NI must be a god-tier teacher.

09:35.050 --> 09:36.120
- Achoo!

09:37.620 --> 09:39.130
- They all fell.

09:39.130 --> 09:41.040
- But they did more dancing\Nthan before, at least.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.070
- Now, the paper udon!

09:43.070 --> 09:44.740
- Let's set it on fire first!

09:44.740 --> 09:46.660
- Isn't that a little dangerous?

09:46.660 --> 09:47.340
- It's lit!

09:47.340 --> 09:48.320
- Listen to me.

09:51.570 --> 09:53.110
- It's hot!

09:58.210 --> 10:01.510
- And... that's the water trick!

10:01.510 --> 10:02.660
- The hell it is!

10:02.660 --> 10:04.660
- Sempai {\c&HDDCA21&}Off {\c&H6A00EE&}Campus

10:03.080 --> 10:04.450
- "Sempai Off Campus."

10:05.900 --> 10:07.230
- Yay!

10:07.230 --> 10:09.230
- Let's spread some magic off campus!

10:09.230 --> 10:10.540
- Magic off campus?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.550
- I thought we were out here because\Nsomeone set the club room on fire.

10:13.810 --> 10:15.710
- Such a lovely day, isn't it?

10:15.710 --> 10:16.800
- Indeed.

10:17.230 --> 10:21.120
- But how are we supposed to do magic\Nwhen you didn't bring your tools?

10:21.120 --> 10:22.800
- I have everything I need right here!

10:23.750 --> 10:24.560
- Oh, God no!

10:24.560 --> 10:25.860
- I can do this!

10:25.860 --> 10:27.130
- No, you can't!

10:27.130 --> 10:30.170
- And isn't taking animals\Nout of the park a crime?

10:30.170 --> 10:31.460
- It'll be fine!

10:31.460 --> 10:34.540
- We won't leave the park,\Nand I'll return them once I'm done!

10:34.540 --> 10:36.820
- That's how a criminal would think!

10:39.740 --> 10:41.070
- They attacked her.

10:42.010 --> 10:45.340
- I'll just have to use this\Numbrella I found, then!

10:45.340 --> 10:47.740
- You'll do tricks with an umbrella\Ninstead of a pigeon?

10:48.870 --> 10:50.850
- I'll climb up to their nest\Nand steal their friggin' eggs!

10:50.850 --> 10:52.080
- That's not a trick at all!

10:52.370 --> 10:56.110
- I've been the best tree-climber\Nin my class since elementary school!

10:56.110 --> 10:58.480
- Another useless fact about Sempai.

10:59.970 --> 11:01.720
- And they just attacked her again.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.730
- I think you made the pigeons mad.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.350
- You should probably come down.

11:06.980 --> 11:08.250
- I can't get down.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.410
- You're kidding me!

11:09.410 --> 11:10.600
- Help me!

11:11.640 --> 11:13.170
- Hey, Assistant-kun, wait!

11:13.170 --> 11:15.730
- I don't want them to think\NI'm in league with an egg thief.

12:24.970 --> 12:30.180
