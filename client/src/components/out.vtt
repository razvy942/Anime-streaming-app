00:04.100 --> 00:06.600
<b>Stop the first-year students 
from causing havoc?</b>

00:06.600 --> 00:08.540
<b>Yeah. He said we could have 
our yakisoba bread stand</b>

00:08.540 --> 00:10.610
<b>at the cultural festival if we do that!</b>

00:10.930 --> 00:14.310
<b>Shibutani Keigo from the athletics 
festival boycott incident.</b>

00:14.310 --> 00:17.540
<b>Fukazawa Saeko from the final 
exams group-cheating incident.</b>

00:17.990 --> 00:19.120
<b>And finally, Asano Ren,</b>

00:19.420 --> 00:21.700
<b>who is causing disturbances brawling 
with students from other schools.</b>

00:21.700 --> 00:24.250
<b>They don't look like such bad kids to me.</b>

00:24.630 --> 00:29.950
<b>Yeah. It appears they were all originally 
popular and respected.</b>

00:29.950 --> 00:33.230
<b>It's hard to believe students like that 
would suddenly cause all this trouble.</b>

00:33.230 --> 00:35.680
<b>Yeah. So who else should pop up but...</b>

00:36.340 --> 00:39.180
<b>Takigawa Noa. The next witch.</b>

00:39.180 --> 00:40.240
<b>Huh?</b>

00:40.240 --> 00:43.080
<b>Not to mention, we have identified her 
power as the opposite of Sarushima's.</b>

00:43.080 --> 00:45.580
<b>Her power is to see the 
past of whoever she kisses.</b>

00:45.580 --> 00:48.310
<b>Hey! This is all going unusually well!</b>

00:48.680 --> 00:53.020
<b>This Takigawa woman could have gotten 
hold of their past insecurities</b>

00:53.020 --> 00:55.310
<b>and be making them do all these awful things.</b>

00:55.860 --> 01:00.280
<b>But why does President 
Yamazaki know all this?</b>

01:00.280 --> 01:03.150
<b>Oh, my. What are you saying 
this late in the game?</b>

01:03.150 --> 01:04.440
<b>You guys?</b>

01:04.440 --> 01:07.520
<b>Witches are succeeded by 
others within the school.</b>

01:07.520 --> 01:10.370
<b>It isn't so strange for the 
president to know about them.</b>

01:10.370 --> 01:11.730
<b>The president should have been</b>

01:11.730 --> 01:14.470
<b>in charge of the second volume of the 
notebook until just recently, as well.</b>

01:14.470 --> 01:15.610
<b>Until just recently?</b>

01:15.610 --> 01:16.870
<b>The clubhouse storage room.</b>

01:18.460 --> 01:20.390
<b>It sounds as though the 
notebook was already gone</b>

01:20.390 --> 01:22.340
<b>when the student council had 
everything cleared out.</b>

01:22.850 --> 01:25.780
<b>That's Takigawa Noa's doing as well.</b>

01:25.780 --> 01:28.850
<b>That's convenient for 
us in all sorts of ways!</b>

01:29.910 --> 01:32.150
<b>I'm gonna go shut Takigawa 
Noa down right now!</b>

01:33.270 --> 01:34.150
<b>How did it come to that?</b>

01:34.470 --> 01:37.060
<b>If we fulfill this request 
from the student council,</b>

01:37.060 --> 01:39.730
<b>we'll get permission to hold 
a yakisoba bread stand,</b>

01:39.730 --> 01:42.570
<b>and we'll get our hands on the second 
volume of the notebook in the process, too?</b>

01:42.570 --> 01:43.370
<b>You got it!</b>

01:43.740 --> 01:46.290
<b>Are you planning to go kiss her 
without planning anything again?</b>

01:46.290 --> 01:52.020
<b>Nope. I'm gonna show her just how 
terrifying upperclassmen can be!</b>

03:25.720 --> 03:29.230
Episode 8 "You're So Annoying"

03:31.190 --> 03:33.530
<b>What in the world does a 
second-year want with us?</b>

03:33.530 --> 03:35.980
<b>This is that Yamada guy 
everyone hates, right?</b>

03:35.980 --> 03:38.020
<b>I don't have any business with you guys.</b>

03:38.020 --> 03:41.110
<b>I'm here for the woman up on 
her high-horse behind you!</b>

03:41.110 --> 03:44.170
<b>Huh? What could it possibly be?</b>

03:44.170 --> 03:45.560
<b>Give me a minute, would ya?</b>

03:48.690 --> 03:54.040
<b>Yamada-senpai, was it? 
What business do you have with me?</b>

03:54.250 --> 03:56.150
<b>Act innocent all you want. It's pointless.</b>

03:56.150 --> 04:00.350
<b>I've heard all about the incidents 
the first-years have caused.</b>

04:00.350 --> 04:04.480
<b>What a bother. Why am I under suspicion?</b>

04:04.480 --> 04:06.470
<b>Those three are the ones who did it all.</b>

04:06.770 --> 04:07.970
<b>Wha?</b>

04:07.970 --> 04:12.940
<b>I tried to stop them, but they 
wouldn't listen to what I had to say.</b>

04:12.940 --> 04:16.540
<b><i>This woman's planning to 
play dumb to the bitter end?</i></b>

04:16.540 --> 04:18.230
<b><i>I'll just have to do it by force, then!</i></b>

04:18.230 --> 04:20.110
<b>By the way, Senpai.</b>

04:20.110 --> 04:22.280
<b>I have a question for you.</b>

04:24.210 --> 04:27.550
<b>What do you think of younger girls?</b>

04:27.550 --> 04:28.280
<b>Huh?</b>

04:28.650 --> 04:33.540
<b>The truth is, I'm interested in older guys.</b>

04:33.540 --> 04:37.620
<b>U-Uh, i-it's not like there's anything 
really wrong with younger girls.</b>

04:37.620 --> 04:43.380
<b>Oh? Could it be you've 
fallen in love with me, Senpai?</b>

04:43.380 --> 04:44.610
<b>Huh?</b>

04:44.610 --> 04:49.280
<b><i>Wh-What's with this girl? 
Don't tell me she's got a thing for me?</i></b>

04:50.540 --> 04:52.810
<b><i>Wait, if she does...</i></b>

04:55.790 --> 04:59.150
<b>Takigawa. In that case, kiss me.</b>

05:00.870 --> 05:05.650
<b><i>If I copy her power and get my 
hands on </i>her<i> weakness instead...</i></b>

05:07.110 --> 05:09.740
<b>What's that all about? You're gross.</b>

05:10.510 --> 05:11.240
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

05:11.620 --> 05:17.250
<b>Heck, I just teased you a little. 
I wasn't serious. You're seriously annoying.</b>

05:18.770 --> 05:20.790
<b>H-Huh?</b>
