<b>By that time,</b>

00:04.240 --> 00:05.290
<b>my life...</b>

00:05.890 --> 00:07.180
<b>had already ended.</b>

00:08.010 --> 00:09.070
<b>What?!</b>

00:11.150 --> 00:13.240
<b>Above us! It's a helicopter!</b>

00:13.540 --> 00:16.490
<b>Now they're cornered.</b>

00:16.490 --> 00:20.850
<b>And whoever Bucciarati and 
his men were meeting in Rome</b>

00:21.390 --> 00:24.330
<b>will be dealt with by Green Tea.</b>

00:25.860 --> 00:29.940
<b>We have to take care of him before the 
mold's killing spree reaches the Colosseum!</b>

00:29.940 --> 00:31.010
<b>Bucciarati,</b>

00:31.500 --> 00:34.260
<b>we can leave the guy beneath 
the ground to you, right?</b>

00:35.440 --> 00:36.900
<b>Go, Giorno!</b>

00:36.900 --> 00:38.410
<b>Run, Mista!</b>

00:38.810 --> 00:40.760
<b>All right! Let's go, Giorno!</b>

00:42.070 --> 00:43.980
<b>Either way...</b>

00:46.150 --> 00:49.940
<b>I'm taking care of you first...</b>

00:50.170 --> 00:52.390
<b>Buccia... rati...</b>

02:26.060 --> 02:30.960
<b>Episodio 31 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 2</b>

02:26.550 --> 02:28.360
<b>Bucciarati...</b>

02:28.360 --> 02:33.610
<b>How dare you ambush 
me back at that village...</b>

02:33.610 --> 02:37.130
<b>I'm never falling for that again.</b>

02:37.130 --> 02:41.180
<b>How dare you do something so cleaver?!</b>

02:41.800 --> 02:44.580
<b>No, wait...</b>

02:44.580 --> 02:47.060
<b>Something so lever... no wait.</b>

02:48.310 --> 02:51.900
<b>Something so beaver... 
wait, or was it sever? Griever?</b>

02:52.140 --> 02:53.440
<b>You mean "clever"?</b>

02:54.400 --> 02:58.500
<b>I knew that, damn it! 
What are you, a language teacher?!</b>

02:59.750 --> 03:03.780
<b>Y-Y-You jerk!</b>

03:03.780 --> 03:07.390
<b>Oh, yeah. I need to record a video.</b>

03:07.390 --> 03:10.250
<b>It shouldn't take me too 
long to take care of you.</b>

03:10.250 --> 03:11.710
<b>Let's see...</b>

03:14.160 --> 03:15.960
<b>Zipper Man!</b>

03:19.120 --> 03:22.510
<b><i>H-He's... His power and speed...</i></b>

03:22.910 --> 03:26.350
<b>I-If we're doing this one-on-one...</b>

03:26.350 --> 03:29.440
<b>I don't even need to dive into the ground.</b>

03:34.980 --> 03:36.860
<b><i>Th-This ability...</i></b>

03:37.350 --> 03:39.740
<b><i>It surpasses my Zipper Man...</i></b>

03:39.740 --> 03:41.400
<b><i>both in speed and in power!</i></b>

03:47.190 --> 03:49.140
<b><i>He's using the ground to give him elasticity</i></b>

03:49.140 --> 03:51.370
<b><i>and increasing his power with that recoil.</i></b>

03:51.730 --> 03:53.130
<b><i>That's why he's fast!</i></b>

03:53.130 --> 03:57.360
<b><i>Just like a boxer using the ring ropes 
to increase the power of his punches!</i></b>

03:59.130 --> 04:01.840
<b>Sanctuary!</b>

04:04.150 --> 04:06.550
<b>Take this! I'm out of time!</b>

04:22.710 --> 04:26.480
<b>As I thought... There's 
no mold growing on you,</b>

04:26.480 --> 04:28.080
<b>even though you fell.</b>

04:28.600 --> 04:33.510
<b>Cioccolata's Green Tea will 
kill any living creature.</b>

04:33.830 --> 04:36.290
<b>What the hell's going on with your body?</b>

04:38.200 --> 04:41.570
<b>I mean, I guess I'll just have to pulverize</b>

04:41.570 --> 04:45.730
<b>every last inch of your body 
until you can't move anymore...</b>

04:45.730 --> 04:50.720
<b>w-w-with my Sanctuary!</b>

04:53.030 --> 04:54.600
<b>Giorno Giovanna!</b>

04:57.710 --> 05:00.530
<b>He has the ability to give objects life.</b>

05:00.530 --> 05:02.940
<b>The bullets that missed...</b>

05:07.110 --> 05:08.490
<b>They're coming.</b>

05:08.820 --> 05:10.530
<b>How dare they underestimate me?</b>

05:10.530 --> 05:14.860
<b>Your life force energy is 
no match for my Green Tea!</b>

05:14.860 --> 05:16.930
<b>I'll rot all of these vines!</b>

05:19.400 --> 05:23.120
<b>Spread your mold! 
We're breaking free of these vines!</b>

05:26.310 --> 05:28.070
<b>Wh-What?!</b>

05:28.070 --> 05:29.940
<b>I can't take off!</b>

05:29.940 --> 05:31.890
<b>It's not moving at all!</b>

05:31.890 --> 05:33.270
<b>Th-That's not good!</b>

05:36.660 --> 05:41.020
<b>It's turned into a tree! 
Now that helicopter is secured.</b>

05:41.300 --> 05:43.860
<b>Mista! We're gonna climb up the 
tree to get to the helicopter!</b>

05:43.860 --> 05:46.460
<b>There's no need, Giorno.</b>

05:46.460 --> 05:49.700
<b>It's well within range of my bullets.</b>

05:52.860 --> 05:55.000
<b>Yee-haw!</b>

05:55.390 --> 05:56.910
<b>Go, Bullets!</b>

05:56.910 --> 05:59.460
<b>Your target is his head!</b>

06:01.170 --> 06:03.140
<b>What?!</b>

06:03.600 --> 06:08.320
<b>Mista! The others are saying they can't 
find him anywhere in the helicopter!</b>

06:10.430 --> 06:14.010
<b>Where is he?! What the hell?!</b>

06:14.010 --> 06:15.890
<b>There's no way he can hide!</b>

06:15.890 --> 06:17.520
<b>He can't get out, either!</b>

06:18.300 --> 06:21.150
<b>Everyone, look for him! Find hiâ€”</b>

06:33.310 --> 06:34.390
<b>Mista!</b>

06:35.950 --> 06:40.370
<b>Number Two! Number Three! 
What happened to you guys?!</b>

06:40.730 --> 06:42.390
<b>Th-That's impossible!</b>

06:42.390 --> 06:44.620
<b>Why isn't he here?</b>

06:44.620 --> 06:47.960
<b>Each Stand should only have one ability!</b>

06:47.960 --> 06:51.030
<b>His ability is to attack you 
with mold if you drop down to</b>

06:51.030 --> 06:53.260
<b>a lower position than 
where you currently stand.</b>

06:53.260 --> 06:55.430
<b>That should be the only one!</b>

06:55.760 --> 06:58.480
<b>Run, Number One...</b>

06:58.860 --> 07:01.260
<b>Number Six! Seven!</b>

07:27.940 --> 07:30.550
<b>I-I underestimated him...</b>

07:36.330 --> 07:39.180
<b>I'll go bring everyone back!</b>

07:42.100 --> 07:45.060
<b>He's captured the Bullets 
that he's destroyed,</b>

07:46.090 --> 07:50.600
<b>because he knows Mista won't be able 
to heal unless he gets his Stand back.</b>

07:50.600 --> 07:51.840
<b>I can't heal him.</b>

07:51.840 --> 07:53.320
<b>N-No...</b>

07:53.800 --> 07:57.800
<b>And he's probably waiting for you to come.</b>

07:57.800 --> 08:01.040
<b>If he manages to destroy you, 
the final Bullet, Mista will die.</b>

08:01.590 --> 08:05.630
<b>He's someone we should've faced head-on!</b>

08:06.110 --> 08:08.940
<b>Mista! I'm leaving Trish and Narancia here.</b>

08:09.650 --> 08:10.510
<b>Right...</b>

08:11.150 --> 08:12.230
<b>Watch over them!</b>

08:15.480 --> 08:18.850
<b>Follow him... Number Five.</b>

08:20.020 --> 08:22.430
<b>Back Giorno up...</b>

08:33.830 --> 08:35.680
<b>I feel a life force...</b>

08:36.280 --> 08:38.980
<b>Why couldn't the Bullets find him?</b>

08:39.590 --> 08:43.790
<b>I don't know his exact location, 
but he didn't leave the helicopter.</b>

08:44.110 --> 08:45.250
<b>In that case...</b>

08:45.250 --> 08:47.200
<b>Golden Wind!</b>

09:22.840 --> 09:26.170
<b>Th-The enemy's true identity is...</b>

09:28.640 --> 09:30.540
<b>Come over here, Number One!</b>

09:30.540 --> 09:34.840
<b>Don't go any closer, Giorno! It's a trap!</b>

09:36.590 --> 09:37.690
<b>Useless!</b>
