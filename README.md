# Anime Streaming App

Desktop app built using Electron, React and Python. It scrapes websites for anime torrent then it streams the video inside the app using mpv. It allows for multiple quality settings(480p, 720p, 1080p), keeps track of what anime you are watching, automatically plays the next episode and informs users whenver a new episode is out.
